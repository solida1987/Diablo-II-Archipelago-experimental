Diablo II Archipelago - World Options

1.8.0 cleanup: options list now mirrors what the in-game title-screen
settings panel offers. Removed options that were AP-only / duplicates /
internal balance knobs:
  - GameMode (deprecated; replaced by SkillHunting + ZoneLocking toggles)
  - SkillPoolSize (always 210; class filter already handles restriction)
  - 6 Filler*Pct options (internal balance — DLL uses sensible defaults)
  - 15 Act<N>_Preload_<Diff> options (AP generates randomly per slot)

# 1.9.9 — Custom Goal scope tables (driven by selected toggles).
#
# These three dicts let `__init__.py` shrink the seed scope to the
# minimum needed for the selected Custom Goal targets, instead of
# always generating the full 700-location 3-difficulty pool. The
# old (1.9.2-1.9.8) behaviour generated everything regardless of
# which targets were picked, which:
#   - made AP fill place items at locations the player would never
#     visit (Hell Act 5 zones for an Andariel Normal goal)
#   - in multiworld, stranded other players' progression items at
#     those out-of-scope slots, requiring `!release` to recover
#
# 1.9.9 fix: compute (max_act, max_diff) from the union of all
# selected toggles' scopes, then propagate to `get_active_locations()`
# and `create_regions()` so the location pool matches what the
# player will actually traverse.
#
# Three lookup tables:
#   _CUSTOM_GOAL_SCOPE          — csv_token -> (min_act, max_diff)
#                                 used to compute the seed's overall scope
#   _CUSTOM_GOAL_TARGET_LOCATIONS — csv_token -> AP location name
#                                 used by set_rules() to AND-of-reachable
#   _CUSTOM_GOAL_SUBSYSTEM_PROXY  — csv_token -> AP location name (proxy)
#                                 fallback for subsystem/bulk toggles that
#                                 don't bind to a single AP location
#
# Rule for max_act when max_diff > 0:
# To physically reach a higher-difficulty kill, the player must beat
# Baal on every lower difficulty (D2's hard-coded act/diff transitions).
# So if any selected target has max_diff > 0, force max_act = 5 to
# include the prereq chain on lower diffs.
