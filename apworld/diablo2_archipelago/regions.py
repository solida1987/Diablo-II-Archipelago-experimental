    locations the player must be able to reach before the milestone is
    considered satisfiable.

    Returns a list of location names (str) or None when no prerequisites are
    needed (low-level milestones in the starting region).

    The intent is purely to push level milestones into spheres LATER
    than the act gate-keys that could otherwise be blocked by them.
    Without this, AP fill places progression items at level-milestone
    locations because they have no access rules — leaving the player
    to grind to that level inside the starting region with no other
    sources of items, which is exactly the soft-lock that R9 reported.

    1.9.10 fix (#3b) — Hell-tier level milestones (L60-75) used to gate
    only on NM Baal kill, which meant AP fill could legitimately place
    Hell-difficulty Act 1 gate keys at "Reach Level 60 (Hell)" — the
    player would have NM access but no Hell Act 1 R3+ access, forcing
    them to grind to L60 in Hell Act 1 R1+R2 only. Same pattern for
    NM-tier (L35-55). Now both tiers also require the same-diff Act 1
    boss kill so the grinding location actually has reachable monsters.

    Diff parameter follows the apworld convention (0=Normal, 1=NM,
    2=Hell). Boss location names get the difficulty suffix appended.
