# Source

The C source for the Diablo II Archipelago mod DLL (`D2Archipelago.dll`), plus
the Archipelago world in `../apworld/`.

The mod is a single translation unit: `d2arch.c` includes every other `.c` file
in a fixed order, so include order is load-bearing — see the list at the top of
`d2arch.c`. Everything hooks Blizzard's original 1.10f `D2Game.dll` /
`D2Client.dll` at documented offsets; none of Blizzard's code or data files are
in this repository.

Built with MSVC via `build.bat` (DLL) and `_build_bootstrap.bat` (launcher exe).
